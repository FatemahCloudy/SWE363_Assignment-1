# AI Usage Report

This document provides a transparent overview of how AI was used during the creation of the **Portfolio Website** project.

---

## Areas Where AI Was Used

1. **Initial Project Structure**
   - Generated the base structure for `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js`.
   - Suggested layout sections: *About Me*, *Projects*, *Skills*, and *Contact*.

2. **Interactive Features**
   - Assisted in implementing front-end interactivity using JavaScript, including:
     - **Form validation** with user feedback.
     - **Pop-up messages** for form submission confirmation.
     - **Scroll-triggered fade-in animations** using the Intersection Observer API.
     - **Automatic dark/light mode** that follows the userâ€™s system preference.
     - **Hover and scaling effects** for project cards and skill bubbles.

4. **Documentation**
   - Generated the initial `README.md` file with setup, features, and deployment info.
   - Drafted this `ai-usage-report.md` for transparency and compliance.

## ðŸ§  Areas Where AI Was *Not* Used

- Writing any personal content in the *About Me* section.
- Choosing images, icons, or colour palette.
- Final UI/UX design choices and creative adjustments.
- Testing and deployment configurations on GitHub Pages.
- Fixing and improving the base AI-generated code.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of AI Use

AI was used as a **coding and design assistant** to:
- Accelerate development.
- Suggest clean, reusable code.
- Provide examples for animations and interactivity.
- 
All generated or suggested code was **reviewed, modified, and approved** by the project owner before inclusion.

## ðŸ”’ Important Notes

- No personal or sensitive information was shared with AI tools.
- All AI-generated code is fully editable and understandable by the project owner.
- The final project remains independently maintainable and extendable.
