## Areas Where AI Was Used

1. **Initial Project Structure**
    - Generated the boilerplate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
    - Suggested a layout with sections: *About Me*, *Projects*, *Skills*, and *Contact*.

2. **Code Snippets**
    - Provided ready-to-use CSS and JavaScript snippets for:
        - Form handling (front-end only)
        - Interactive effects (e.g. scaling and floating animations )
        - Hover animations (e.g. project cards scaling, bubble hover effect)
        - Bubble-style design for skills section

3. **Documentation**
    - Drafted the `README.md` file with project description, setup instructions, and deployment guidance.
    - Created this `ai-usage-report.md` file for compliance and transparency.

## Areas Where AI Was *Not* Used

- Personal information and text content (e.g., "About Me" section).
- Making decisions about the colours used in the website.
- Choosing and adding images.
- Finalizing the styling of the website.

## Purpose of AI Use

AI was used as a **coding assistant** to speed up development and provide design inspiration.  
Final decisions on layout, styling, and content were made by the project owner.

##  Important Notes

- No sensitive or private data was shared with AI during this project.
- The AI-generated code was reviewed and edited by the project owner before inclusion.
- The project remains fully customizable and can be further developed without AI assistance.
